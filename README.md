act-axion-analysis
==============================

Overview
--------

This repo contains code to study time-dependent polarization rotations that could be induced in CMB polarization measurements made by the Atacama Cosmology Telescope by axion-like particles. The notebooks folder contains various Jupyter notebooks for testing aspects of the code, the scripts folder contains the code to run the power spectrum based angle estimation from the command line (including the yaml config file), and the resources folder contains any additional files that are loaded in by the code.

These files were uploaded from a larger working environment that contains data files, so the paths in the config file and some of the scripts and notebooks need to be modified to point to the correct location for the right kind of data to run these. 

Installation
------------
Currently must install from GitHub directly via ```git clone```
